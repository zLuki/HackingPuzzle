# Hacking puzzle

Your task is to solve all the puzzles in this repository.
In each folder there is a task that can be solved only by the hint of the solution of the last puzzle.
The puzzles are sorted by ascending difficulty (from very easy to almost unsolvable).
With each solved puzzle you get a hint and a solution key that you should write down, because you will need it later.

Good luck!
