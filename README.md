		Your task is to solve all the puzzles in this repository.<br>
		In each folder there is a task that can be solved only by the hint of the solution of the last puzzle.<br>
		The puzzles are sorted by ascending difficulty (from very easy to almost unsolvable).<br>
		With each solved puzzle you get a hint and a solution key that you should write down, because you will need it later.<br>
		<br>
		Good luck!<br>

		The hint for the first puzzle is HEX / ASCII
